  "ChangeLog": "- I SET WRONG DTC FLAG OOPS + You should not be detected by the modified client detections anymore (thanks to the atrexus post on v3rm), this HOWEVER MAY NOT LAST LONG (roblox will not let this slide for long!) (Still use alts though) !!!!! + Fixed a issue where joining the game would crash under certain circumstances (NO MORE CRASHING HOPEFULLY) + Fixed a issue where if you would leave a game or join another game with websocket connected it would crash"
